# Gomoku-Game-by-React

Inspired from [Tic-Tac-Toe game](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) of React, I created this Gomoku game with a lot of fun!

I overwrote the "calculateWinner" function, added chess pieces, and modified the layout of the game.

(Note: I used absolute path for convenience.)
