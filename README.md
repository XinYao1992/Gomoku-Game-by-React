# Gomoku-Game-by-React

This Gomoku game is created based on the [Tic-Tac-Toe game](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) of React.

I overwrote the "calculateWinner" function, added chess pieces, and modified the layout of the game.

(Note: I used absolute path for convenience.)
